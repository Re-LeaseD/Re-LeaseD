Introduction
GitHub Badges can boost the readability of the GitHub repositories because they provide users with a fast way to capture repository metrics. Badges are supposed to be embedded in your README.md which elucidates the importance and necessity of your project to other developers.
There are tons of different flamboyant GitHub badges available on the internet, but in this article, we‚Äôll see the top 5 badges that we can include in our README.md file.
What Can GitHub Badges Do For You?
Adding GitHub badges to your repository might seem trivial, but in fact, it is incredibly useful. All you need to do is import Markdown code from the source to your README.md file.
When I created my Python Programming GitHub repository, I omitted badges. My unembellished repository had the right contents but didn‚Äôt stand out. Because of this, the repository gained very little traffic (unique visitors).
After adding more badges to my repository, I saw an automatic rise in the external visitors (from 5 to 767) monthly (view your unique visitors in Insights > Traffic on your repository.)
My Inbox was filled with comments about how well my repository stood out from other Python programming repositories ‚Äî all because of badges. A simple GitHub badge can completely change the look of your repository.
Always keep this in mind: a badge is worth 1000 lines of code.
1. GitHub Stats
The GitHub Stats badge demonstrates the total Stars, Commits, Pull Requests, Issues, and Contributions of your GitHub repository. The explanations of the above technical terminologies are provided down below.
Stars: Saving other GitHub repositories. This indicates that the user is interested and would stay up-to-date with the repository. When we ‚ÄúStar‚Äù a repository editing the contents is certainly not possible.
Commits: Saving a change in a repository is often called Commits. Commit usually have a lot of details appended to it such as contents, message, author name, and time stamp.
Pull Request: Pull requests let you inform someone about the improvements you‚Äôve pushed to the GitHub repository branch.
Issues: GitHub Issues are used to get user feedback, track ideas, enhancements, and bug reporting.
Contribution: GitHub Contributions indicate the number of contributions that have been made to other repositories. A contribution can be made with the help of a Pull Request.
To add the GitHub Stats badge to your Repository all you have to do is add the below markdown code in your README.md file.
![Your Repository‚Äôs Stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=Your_GitHub_Username&show_icons=true)
Make sure you change the username = value to your GitHub‚Äôs username.
The GitHub Stats badge also provides ranks as well such as S+ (top 1%), S (top 25%), A++ (top 45%), A+ (top 60%), and B+ (everyone). The higher your stats the better would be your ranking.

2. Most Used Languages
As the name suggests the Most Used Languages badge displays the most common languages used throughout GitHub. Or in other words, it is a GitHub metric of which languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Go and many more have the most code on GitHub.The languages are listed in descending order.
To add the Most Used Languages badge to your Repository all you have to do is add the below markdown code in your README.md file.
![Your Repository's Stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=Your_GitHub_Username&theme=blue-green)
Make sure you change the username= value to your GitHub‚Äôs username.

GitHub Most Used Languages of my Repository
The only language which would not be listed by the above badge is Markdown. This is its only drawback.
3. Contributors Badge
The Contributors Badge as the name suggests displays all the contributors that have performed additions, deletions, and commits performed on your repository. The contributor‚Äôs Badge can be generated using contributors-img which is a web application that generates an image to display contributors of your GitHub repository.
<!-- Copy-paste in your Readme.md file -->
<a href = "https://github.com/Your_GitHub_Username/Your_Repository_Name/graphs/contributors">
<img src = "https://contrib.rocks/image?repo = GitHub_username/repository_name"/>
</a>
Made with [contributors-img](https://contrib.rocks).
Make sure you add your credentials such as your GitHub username and repository name to generate the badge.

4. Random Joke Generator
This is one of the coolest GitHub badges on the list. Because it will generate a random joke every 15 minutes or so. Believe the random joke generator each time will generate a technical joke in the form of questions and answers. For instance ‚ÄúWhat is a Computer Virus?‚Äù the answer will be ‚ÄúThe Terminal illness‚Äù. Isn‚Äôt that funny.
Anyways, to extend the Badge you need to embed the Markdown code in your README.md file as shown below.

5. Profile View Counter
The Profile View Counter badge displays the number of times your GitHub profile has been viewed and displays them in your profile. To generate the badge embed the following Markdown code shown below.

Profile Views
In order to generate your view count of your repository, then you might want to use the HITS (How Idiots Track Success) badge. It is a simple way to see how many people have visited your GitHub repository. Embed the below Markdown code to generate HITS.
![Hits](https://hitcounter.pythonanywhere.com/count/tag.svg?url = Paste_Your_GitHub_Repository_Link_Here)

Profile Hits
But the disadvantage of both the Profile View counter and HITS is that it does not display the count of the unique views. Each time when you reload the counts would be incremented.
Full Implementation
For all the GitHub Badges discussed above, the Markdown Code is represented via the README.md file as shown below. I have used my GitHub repository to demonstrate the example.
